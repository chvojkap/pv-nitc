\section{Efficient Instantiation of SS-NIZK}\label{sec:nizk}
In this section we provide an efficient NIZK proof system for the language 
\[
L = \left\{(h_1, h_2, c_0, c_1, c_2)| \exists (m,r):
\begin{aligned}
       (\land_{i=1}^3 c_i = h_i^{rN}(1+N)^m \bmod N^2) \land \\
       c_0 = g^r \bmod N\\
    \end{aligned}
    \right\}, 
\]
where $g, h_3, N$ are parameters defining the language. The advantage of encrypting the message twice using shared randomness is that the tuple $(c_0, (h_1\cdot (h_2)^{-1}), (c_1\cdot (c_2)^{-1}))$ is DDH tuple. Therefore, we can instantiate required NIZK using a Sigma protocol that proofs that given tuple is a DDH tuple. This Sigma protocol can be turned into an efficient simulation-sound NIZK in the ROM using the Fiat-Shamir transformation. We remark that we have to design a sigma protocol in hidden order group setting, since order of the group $\qrn$ is known neither by prover nor by verifier. Current constructions of Sigma protocols in hidden order groups are far less efficient than standard Sigma protocols. However, we observe that to obtain simulation-sound NIZK, it is sufficient to design a Sigma protocol which has a negligible soundness error and we do not have to care about special soundness. In this way we are able to avoid the strong RSA assumption which is often needed in Sigma protocols in hidden order groups to prove special soundness. Therefore we are able to avoid both using an unnecessary large modulus $N$ and large number of sequential repetitions as discussed in \cite{SPEED:BKSST}. 
%Hence it is possible to sample individual messages of our Sigma protocol  from the sets which are smaller than the sets typically used in Sigma protocols in hidden order groups where one is interested in special soundness. 
This results in particularly short proofs. 
%   Essentially, we use the sigma protocol described in \cite{SCN:BiaMasVen16} which can be turn i Since the order of the group $\qrn$ is not known, we provide detailed proof that the constructed sigma protocol is indeed complete, special sound, special honest verifier zero-knowledge and has quasi-unique responses.  

We recall at first definition of a Sigma protocol. 

\begin{definition} A Sigma protocol for an NP language $L$ and a corresponding binary relation $\rel$ is an interactive 3-move protocol $\Sigma$ between two interactive algorithms which we will call $\prv$ and $\vrf$. $\prv$ is given input a statement and a witness $(s, w)$ and the $\vrf$ is given as input a statement $s$. The protocol works as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\prv$ starts the protocol by computing a message $\fm$, called the \emph{commitment}, and sends $\fm$ to $\vrf$. \emph{commitment}, and a state $\st$. The message $\fm$ is sent to the $\vrf$.
\item $\vrf$ receives $\fm$ and samples a \emph{challenge} $\sm$ uniformly from a finite challenge space $\scset$ and sends it to the $\prv$.
\item $\prv$ receives the challenge $c$ end computes a \emph{response} $\tm \in \thset$. It sends the response $\tm$ to $\vrf$.
\item $\vrf$ runs a deterministic function $\vr(s,\fm,\sm,\tm)$ which outputs 0 or 1 meaning reject or accept, respectively.
\end{enumerate}
A triple $(\fm,\sm,\tm)$ is called a \emph{transcript} of the Sigma protocol. A transcript $(\fm,\sm,\tm)$ is called an \emph{accepting} transcript for $s$ if it cause $\vr(s,\fm,\sm,\tm) =1$. 
We say that a $\Sigma$-protocol is \emph{complete} if for all $(s, w) \in \rel$ it holds that whenever a $\prv(s,w)$ and a $\vrf(s)$ interact, then the $\vrf$ always accepts. 
\end{definition}


%\begin{definition}[Special Honest Verifier Zero-Knowledge]
%We say that a Sigma protocol for relation $\rel \subseteq \sset \times \wset$ with challenge space $\scset$ is \emph{special honest verifier zero-knowledge (SHVZK)}, if there exists a PPT simulator $\simul$ which takes as input $(s, \sm) \in \sset \times \scset$ such that:
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item  For all $s \in \sset, \sm \in \scset$ it holds:
%\[\Pr[\vr(s,\fm,\sm,\tm)=1: (\fm,\tm) \leftarrow \simul(s,\sm)] = 1.\]
%\item For all $(s, w) \in \rel$, if we compute 
%\[(\fm,\tm) \leftarrow \simul(s,\sm)\]
%with uniformly random $\sm \rand \scset$, then $(\fm,\sm,\tm)$ has the same distribution as a transcript of a conversation between the $\prv(s,w)$ and the $\vrf(s)$.
%\end{enumerate}
%\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Honest Verifier Zero-Knowledge]
We say that a Sigma protocol for an NP language  $L$ is \emph{honest verifier zero-knowledge (HVZK)}, if there exists a PPT simulator $\simul$ which takes as input $s \in L$ and outputs transcript $(\fm,\sm,\tm)$ that is computationally indistinguishable from honest
transcripts resulting from interactions between $\prv$ and $\vrf$ on common input $s$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Soundness]
We say that a Sigma protocol for an NP language $L$ is \emph{sound}, if $x \notin L$ then any malicious adversary $\adv$ (even unbounded) is accepted only with negligible probability.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Quasi Unique Responses]
Let $\Sigma$ be a Sigma protocol. We say that $\Sigma$ has \emph{quasi unique responses} if for every non-uniform polynomial-size adversary $\adv = \{\adv_\secpar\}_{\secpar \in \nats}$ there exists a negligible function $\negl(\cdot)$ such that for all $\secpar \in \nats$ 
\[\Pr\left[ \vr(s,\fm,\sm,\tm) = \vr(s,\fm,\sm,\tm' ) = 1 \land \tm \neq \tm' : (s, \fm, \sm , \tm, \tm')\leftarrow \adv_\secpar \right] \leq \negl(\secpar).\]
\end{definition}

Faust \etal \cite{INDOCRYPT:FKMV12} have shown that Sigma protocol fulfilling the above definitions can be turned into simulation-sound NIZK via the Fiat-Shamir transform. 

\begin{theorem}[\cite{INDOCRYPT:FKMV12}]\label{thm:fs}
Consider a non-trivial three-round public-coin honest verifier zero-knowledge interactive proof system $(\prv, \vrf)$ for an NP language $L$, with quasi unique responses. In the random oracle model, the proof system $(\prove, \vrfy)$ derived from $(\prv, \vrf)$ via the Fiat-Shamir transform is a simulation-sound NIZK with respect to its canonical simulator $\simul$.
\end{theorem}

Now we are ready to describe our Sigma protocol $\Sigma = (\prv, \vrf)$ for language $L$:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\prv$ samples $\alpha \rand \smplset$, computes $a_0:=g^\alpha, a_1:= (h_1\cdot h_2^{-1})^\alpha$ and sends $(a_0, a_1)$ to $\vrf$.
\item $\vrf$ samples $v \rand [2^d]$ and sends $v$ to $\prv$.
\item $\prv$ computes the response $z:= \alpha + v \cdot r$ and sends it to $\vrf$.
\item $\vrf$ accepts if and only if $g^z = a_0 \cdot c_0^v \bmod N \land (h_1\cdot h_2^{-1})^z = a_1 \cdot (c_1\cdot c_2^{-1})^v$ and $z \in [\estord + v\estord]$.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{theorem}
If the factoring assumption holds relative $\genmod$, then the above defined protocol $\Sigma = (\prv, \vrf)$ is a Sigma protocol for language $L$ that is perfectly complete, honest verifier zero-knowledge, sound and has quasi-unique responses. 
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof} 
We prove required properties. 

\paragraph{Completeness.} We verify the given requirements:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $g^z = g^{\alpha + v \cdot r} = g^\alpha + (g^r)^v = a_0 \cdot c_0^v \bmod N$;
\item $(h_1\cdot h_2^{-1})^z = (h_1\cdot h_2^{-1})^{\alpha + v \cdot r} = (h_1\cdot h_2^{-1})^\alpha \cdot (h_1^r\cdot (h_2^r)^{-1})^v = a_1 \cdot (h_1^r \cdot m \cdot (h_2^r \cdot m)^{-1})^v = a_1 \cdot (c_1\cdot c_2^{-1})^v$;
\item since $r, \alpha \in \smplset$ and $v \in [2^d]$, therefore $z:= \alpha + v \cdot r \in [ \estord + v\estord]$. 
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{HVZK.} The simulator $\simul((c_0, c_1, c_2))$ works as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Samples $v \rand [2^d], z \rand [\estord + v\estord]$.
\item Computes $a_0:= g^z \cdot c_0^{-v}, a_1:= (h_1 \cdot h_2^{-1})^z \cdot (c_1 \cdot c_2^{-1})^{-v}$ and returns $((a_0, a_1), v, z)$.
\end{enumerate}
It is easy to verify that produced transcript is accepting and moreover it has the same distribution as a honest transcript. 

%\paragraph{SHVZK.} The simulator $\simul((c_0, c_1, c_2), v)$ works as follows:
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item Samples $z \rand [\estord + v\estord]$.
%\item Computes $a_0:= g^z \cdot c_0^{-v}, a_1:= (h_1 \cdot h_2^{-1})^z \cdot (c_1 \cdot c_2^{-1})^{-v}$ and returns $(a_0, a_1), z$.
%\end{enumerate}
%It is easy to verify that produced transcript is accepting and moreover if $v$ is sampled uniformly at random from $[2^d]$, then the given transcript has the same distribution as a honest transcript. 

\paragraph{Soundness.} Let $((a_0, a_1), v, z)$ is accepting transcript for $(c_0, c_1, c_2) \notin L$. That means $c_0 = g^{r_0}, (c_1\cdot (c_2)^{-1}) = (h_1\cdot (h_2)^{-1})^{r_1} \bmod N$ and $r_0 \neq r_1 \mod \varphi(N)$. Let $a_0 = g^{\alpha_0} \bmod N, a_1 = (h_1\cdot (h_2)^{-1})^{\alpha_1} \bmod N$. Considering the first verification equation with respect to discrete logarithm with bases $g$ and the second verification equation with respect to discrete logarithm with bases $(h_1 \cdot h_2^{-1})$, we obtain following equations:
\begin{align}
z = \alpha_0 + r_0 v \bmod \ord\\
z = \alpha_1 + r_1 v \bmod \ord
\end{align}
Computing (1)-(2) we obtain
\begin{align*}
0 = (\alpha_0 - \alpha_1)+ (r_0-r_1)v \bmod \ord \\
v = \frac{\alpha_1 - \alpha_0}{r_0-r_1} \bmod \ord
\end{align*}
Now notice that values $\alpha_0, \alpha_1, r_0, r_1$ are fixed before challenge $v$ is provided by $\vrf$. Therefore in order to provide accepting proof, the adversary has to correctly guess value $v$. If we choose $2^d < \ord$ value $v$ is unique and therefore probability the adversary produce accepting transcript for a statement that is not in $L$ is at most $2^{-d}$ which can be set to be negligible in $\secpar$. This holds even for unbounded adversaries. 

%Let $((a_0, a_1), v, z), ((a_0, a_1), v', z')$ are two accepting transcripts such that $v \neq v'$. Then $g^z = a_0 \cdot g^{rv} \bmod N$ and $g^{z'} = a_0 \cdot g^{rv'} \bmod N$. Hence $r = (z-z') \cdot (v-v')^{-1}$ a since $v \neq v'$


\paragraph{Quasi Unique Responses.} We show that our sigma protocol has quasi unique responses, otherwise we are able to factorize $N$. Assume that an adversary can output a statement $((c_0, c_1, c_2), (a_0, a_1), v, z, z')$ such that $((a_0, a_1), v, z), (a_0, a_1), v, z')$ are accepting transcripts for $(c_0, c_1, c_2)$ and $z \neq z'$. Therefore using the first verification equation it holds $g^z = a_0 \cdot c_0^v = g^{z'} \bmod N \implies z = z' \bmod \ord$. Hence, $z-z' = \alpha \cdot \ord$ for some $\alpha \neq 0$. Applying \Cref{factor-lemma} we are able to factorize $N$.

This concludes the proof.
\end{proof}

By \Cref{thm:fs} our Sigma protocol can be turned into simulation-sound NIZK via the Fiat-Shamir transform.
