\section{Standard Model Constructions}
In this section we construct two non-malleable non-interactive timed commitments whose security can be proven in standard model and which are either linearly or multiplicatively homomorphic.  The constructions relies on a non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs in so-called common reference string setting.
