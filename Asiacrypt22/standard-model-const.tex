\section{Standard Model Constructions}
In this section we construct two non-malleable non-interactive timed commitment schemes whose security can be proven in standard model and which are either linearly (i.e., additively) or multiplicatively homomorphic.  he constructions rely on non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs in the common reference string model.

\input{construction-mh}

We defer the constructions of non-malleable non-interactive timed commitments in the random oracle model to \Cref{sec:rom-const}.
