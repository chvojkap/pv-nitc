\section{Random Oracle Model Constructions}\label{sec:rom-const}
We are able to obtain more efficient construction of non-malleable non-interactive timed commitments when we instantiate the non-interactive zero-knowledge proof systems in the random oracle model \cite{CCS:BelRog93}. Since the underlying languages and proofs differ in some subtle but crucial ways from the standard model constructions, we provide the constructions together with proofs in full detail.
