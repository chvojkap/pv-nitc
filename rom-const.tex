\section{Random Oracle Model Constructions}
We are able to obtain more efficient construction of non-malleable non-interactive timed commitments when we instantiate non-interactive zero-knowledge proof systems in the random oracle model. Since the underlying languages and proofs slightly differ from standard model constructions, we provide the proposed constructions together with proofs in full detail. At first we recall the definition of simulation-sound NIZK in ROM.
